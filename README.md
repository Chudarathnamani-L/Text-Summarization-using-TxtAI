# Text-Summarization-using-TxtAI
Text Summarization GenAI project using TxtAI

# Overview
This project focuses on developing a textual paragraph summarizer using the TxtAI library, Streamlit, and PyPDF2. The application allows users to input text or upload PDF documents, and then generates concise summaries using advanced natural language processing techniques.

# Features
* Text Summarization: Summarizes user-provided text inputs in real-time.
* Document Summarization: Extracts and summarizes text from uploaded PDF files.
* User-friendly Interface: Interactive and intuitive interface built with Streamlit.
* Real-time Processing: Provides instant summarization results.
